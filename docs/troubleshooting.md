# Troubleshooting & FAQ

[← docs home](./index.md)

## "Node.js not found" / `REQUEST_INVALID_HMAC` (code 10005)

Every request needs the `X-Hmac` signature, computed by Node + `ltsm.wasm`.

- Install **Node.js 18+** and make sure `node --version` works in the same shell.
- Non-standard path? `set LINE_NODE=C:\path\to\node.exe` (Windows) /
  `export LINE_NODE=/path/to/node`, or
  `OkLine(config=LineConfig(node_path="..."))`.
- For offline unit tests only, you can disable signing with
  `OkLine(config=LineConfig(enable_hmac=False))` (requests will then be rejected
  by the real server — this is for mocked tests).

## The phone shows "an error occurred" after scanning the QR

The QR must carry `?secret=<curve25519 pubkey>&e2eeVersion=1`. OkLine adds this
automatically in `auth.qr_login` — make sure you render the URL passed to your
`on_qr` callback (not some other URL), and that you're on a current version.

## The QR is unreadable in the terminal

- Light-background terminal: `print_qr(url, invert=True)`.
- Windows console garbling the blocks: run `chcp 65001` first, or use Windows
  Terminal / PowerShell 7.
- Make it bigger: `print_qr(url, style="full")` (double width).

## A response is `None` or a key is missing (`KeyError`)

The gateway wraps results as `{"message":"OK","data":...}`; OkLine unwraps
`.data`. If you call the transport very directly you may see the envelope. Turn
on raw logging to see exactly what came back:

```bash
LINE_DEBUG=1 python your_script.py
```

A non-`OK` envelope is raised as `LineApiError` (with `.code`, `.reason`).

## `401` / token expired

- Pass a `refresh_token` so OkLine auto-refreshes on `401`:
  `OkLine(access_token=..., refresh_token=...)`.
- Or refresh manually: `api.auth.refresh_access_token()`.
- If the session was revoked (logged out on another device), log in again.

## `LineMustUpgradeError` / `MUST_UPGRADE`

The server wants a newer client version. The bundled app version is `3.7.2`; if
LINE forces an upgrade you may need a newer `ltsm.wasm` + version string from a
fresh extension build (`LineConfig(app_version=...)`, `ltsm_origin=...`).

## Reading errors

```python
from okline import LineApiError, enums

try:
    api.send_text(to, "hi")
except LineApiError as e:
    print(e.code, e.reason, e.metadata)
    # map a numeric code to a name:
    print(enums.ErrorCode(e.code).name if e.code is not None else "?")
```

Common `ErrorCode`s: `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`(1), `NOT_AUTHORIZED_DEVICE`(8),
`NOT_FRIEND`(36), `MUST_UPGRADE`(50), `EXPIRED_REVISION`(52),
`MUST_REFRESH_V3_TOKEN`(119). Full list in
[`okline/enums.py`](../okline/enums.py).

## Long-poll / SSE seems to hang

That's expected — `iter_operations()` and the verify long-polls block until
something happens or the server times out. Use a thread, or set
`qr_login(wait_seconds=...)`.

## Rate limits / abuse blocks

`EXCESSIVE_ACCESS`(4), `ABUSE_BLOCK`(35), `CONGESTION_CONTROL`(58) mean you're
sending too fast or tripping anti-abuse. Slow down and only use your own account.

## Still stuck?

Capture a redacted transcript and inspect it:

```python
api.save_log("debug.txt")          # secrets masked by default
print(api.last.pretty())
```
